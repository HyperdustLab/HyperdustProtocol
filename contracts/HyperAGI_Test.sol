/**
 * @title Hyperdust_Render_Awards
 * @dev This contract is responsible for distributing rewards to active nodes in the Hyperdust Protocol.
 * It uses a random selection process to choose a node and distributes an epoch award to it.
 * The epoch award is calculated based on the total supply of the protocol and the number of active nodes.
 * A portion of the epoch award is kept as security deposit and the rest is released as base reward to the node.
 * The contract also keeps track of the total award and residue total award available for distribution.
 * Only the admin role can trigger the rewards distribution.
