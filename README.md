## HyperAGI

HyperAGI is the world's first blockchain designed to realise Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) through AGI. It features a robust GPU DePin infrastructure, a decentralised embodied AI computing framework, and personal agents based on exclusive aspect-oriented artificial neural programming.

HyperAGI offers a comprehensive technical and product stack for decentralized AGI, including PoUW GPU DePIN for 3D rendering and AI inference, decentralized AI microservices, peer-to-peer 3D AI Gym space, and an LLM-driven AGI agent framework and application.

Consumer-grade GPU nodes are invited to join our network without permission, enabling them to mine the native token, $HYPT, by performing PoUW tasks such as AI inference and 3D rendering. These programmable agents can issue or own cryptocurrency assets, continuously operate, and trade, contributing to a vibrant, autonomous crypto economy that supports the realization of UBAI.

Users can utilize various tools to develop their LLM-driven Proof of Personhood (PoP) agents or utility agents and train these embodied agents in 3D simulation space. These agents can be configured as chatbots, embodied avatars within the metaverse, or even downloaded to real-world robots, drones, or other autonomous vehicles.

AI developers can instantly utilize or deploy LLM AI microservices, facilitating the creation of programmable, autonomous on-chain agents.

#### HyperAGI Smart Contracts

The smart contracts of the HyperAGI are the core of the HyperAGI  platform, containing the main functionalities of the platform.

- `Hyperdust_AirDrop`: The airdrop contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, used for centralized bulk airdrops to users by the Hyperdust Protocol.

- `Hyperdust_Faucet.sol`: The faucet contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, from which users can obtain Hyperdust Tokens.

- `Hyperdust_Roles_Cfg.sol`: The role management contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for the determination of global administrator roles and the maintenance of administrator roles.

- `Hyperdust_GYM_Space.sol`: The space contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for managing all Hyperspaces and generating a SID for each Hyperspace.

- `Hyperdust_Transaction_Cfg.sol`: The transaction configuration contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for storing the HYPT Gas costs for different sections and configuring the minimum GAS charge authorization.

- `Hyperdust_Wallet_Account.sol`: The wallet account contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for holding Hyper gas fees on the L2 chain and generating detailed records.

- `Hyperdust_BaseReward_Release.sol`: The basic reward release contract for miners in the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for releasing the basic reward tokens mined by miners according to a specified release cycle, through which miners collect released HYPT.

- `Hyperdust_Epoch_Awards.sol`: The mining contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, through which miners earn HYPT tokens by mining.

- `Hyperdust_Epoch_Transaction.sol`: The Hyperdust protocol's epoch transaction contract, where users initiate transactions on the epoch through this contract, utilizing the Hyperdust network's computing resources.

- `Hyperdust_Security_Deposit.sol`: The miner's security deposit contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, where 10% of the HYPT earned by miners from mining is stored as a quality guarantee deposit for miner services.

- `Hyperdust_GPUMining.sol`: The mining wallet contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for storing the monthly mining token funds.

- `Hyperdust_Token.sol`: The HYPT Token contract of the Hyperdust Protocol.

- `Hyperdust_VestingWallet.sol`: The wallet contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for the release of tokens for the Airdrop, PublicSale, PrivateSale, Seed, Advisor, Foundation, CoreTeam sections.

- `Hyperdust_Node_CheckIn.sol`: The miner registration verification contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for the on-chain verification of miner registrations.

- `Hyperdust_Node_Mgr.sol`: The miner management contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for maintaining information, status, current online numbers, rendering numbers, and other maintenance tasks of miner nodes.

- `Hyperdust_Node_Type.sol`: Miner type management contract, responsible for maintaining miner node type information.
