## HyperAGI

HyperAGI (was Hyperdust) is a Layer 2 solution on Bitcoin, focusing on decentralized AGI applications and fostering an autonomous cryptocurrency economy, with the ultimate goal of establishing Unconditional Basic Agent Income (UBAI). It inherits Bitcoin's robust security and decentralization, enhanced by the innovative Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) consensus mechanism.

Consumer-grade GPU nodes are invited to join the network without permission, enabling them to mine the native token, $HYPT, by performing PoUW tasks such as AI inference and 3D rendering.

Users can utilize various tools to develop their LLM-driven Proof of Personhood (PoP) AGI agents. These agents can be configured as chatbots or as 3D/XR entities within the metaverse. AI developers can instantly utilize or deploy LLM AI microservices, facilitating the creation of programmable, autonomous on-chain agents.

These programmable agents are capable of issuing or owning cryptocurrency assets, and can continuously operate or trade, contributing to a vibrant, autonomous crypto economy that supports the realization of UBAI.

Owners of at least one Hyper•AGI•Agent runes token on Bitcoin Layer 1 qualify to create a PoP agent on Hyper Chain and may soon be eligible for UBAI benefits.

#### HyperAGI Smart Contracts

The smart contracts of the HyperAGI are the core of the HyperAGI  platform, containing the main functionalities of the platform.

- `Hyperdust_AirDrop`: The airdrop contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, used for centralized bulk airdrops to users by the Hyperdust Protocol.

- `Hyperdust_Faucet.sol`: The faucet contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, from which users can obtain Hyperdust Tokens.

- `Hyperdust_Roles_Cfg.sol`: The role management contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for the determination of global administrator roles and the maintenance of administrator roles.

- `Hyperdust_GYM_Space.sol`: The space contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for managing all Hyperspaces and generating a SID for each Hyperspace.

- `Hyperdust_Transaction_Cfg.sol`: The transaction configuration contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for storing the HYPT Gas costs for different sections and configuring the minimum GAS charge authorization.

- `Hyperdust_Wallet_Account.sol`: The wallet account contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for holding Hyper gas fees on the L2 chain and generating detailed records.

- `Hyperdust_BaseReward_Release.sol`: The basic reward release contract for miners in the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for releasing the basic reward tokens mined by miners according to a specified release cycle, through which miners collect released HYPT.

- `Hyperdust_Epoch_Awards.sol`: The mining contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, through which miners earn HYPT tokens by mining.

- `Hyperdust_Epoch_Transaction.sol`: The Hyperdust protocol's epoch transaction contract, where users initiate transactions on the epoch through this contract, utilizing the Hyperdust network's computing resources.

- `Hyperdust_Security_Deposit.sol`: The miner's security deposit contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, where 10% of the HYPT earned by miners from mining is stored as a quality guarantee deposit for miner services.

- `Hyperdust_GPUMining.sol`: The mining wallet contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for storing the monthly mining token funds.

- `Hyperdust_Token.sol`: The HYPT Token contract of the Hyperdust Protocol.

- `Hyperdust_VestingWallet.sol`: The wallet contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for the release of tokens for the Airdrop, PublicSale, PrivateSale, Seed, Advisor, Foundation, CoreTeam sections.

- `Hyperdust_Node_CheckIn.sol`: The miner registration verification contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for the on-chain verification of miner registrations.

- `Hyperdust_Node_Mgr.sol`: The miner management contract of the Hyperdust Protocol, responsible for maintaining information, status, current online numbers, rendering numbers, and other maintenance tasks of miner nodes.

- `Hyperdust_Node_Type.sol`: Miner type management contract, responsible for maintaining miner node type information.
